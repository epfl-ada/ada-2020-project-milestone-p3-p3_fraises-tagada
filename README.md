Racial Disparities in police stops accross the United States between different political parties

Pierson et al. have previously collected a data set about traffic stops accross the USA. Their data set suggest that there exists a racial bias in stop decisions. However they did not investigate differences between states. We therefore propose an extension to their work by inspecting potential disparities between the states based on their political dominance. An Oxford study supports the fact that 'an individual's personality significantly contributes to contemporary political allegiance and engagement' [1]. Thus we hypothesize that the political dominance of a state reflects the average personality of it's population, and that it can be observed through differences in levels of racial disparities in police stops. In other words, this study aims to see whether the political affiliation of the state impacts the racial disparities in police stops.
